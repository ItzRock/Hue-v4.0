<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hue v4.0 is a discord bot which allows servers which need to verify the users who are joining their servers with their relevant account, for example: `Garry's mod or other Steam Game community needs to verify that a user is indeed a steam account` or `A Roblox community needs a user to verify as their roblox account` and lastly `A minecraft server needs to verify a user as their minecraft account` The only limitation of this (currently) is you can only have one service enabled per discord server.

Discord js v13 and not v14? Discord.js v14 absolutely sucks it takes simple things and makes it 10x harder by forcing a type or a new enum which you need to import when before it only required a string. Additonally `embed.setColor` requires `0xcode` now? instead of `"#code"` what?

Additionally this bot was designed to work in the Pterodactyl panel so there may be some features which may or may not break without it, I still need to figure out what to add to the readme as I am still working on this and its still very early
